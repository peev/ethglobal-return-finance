## Return.finance
We enable mass adoption of DeFi by a user-friendly savings app that lets you earn up to a 10% APY on your fiat USD.

## Project Description
Return Finance is building a bridge between the worlds of TradFi and DeFi via a platform designed for individuals and businesses to earn yield on their fiat USD. 

Funds received from the traditional banking system are automatically converted into USDC through the Circel API and provided as liquidity to some of the leading trading and lending protocols such as Curve, AAVE, Uniswap and more comprehensive dApps such as yEarn, Convex and Conic Finance.
